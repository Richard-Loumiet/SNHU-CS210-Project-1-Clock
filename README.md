SNHU CS210 Project 1 Clock
The point of this project was to creat a clock that would adjust based on a user input. It didn't use the system time, but was only altered by a set amount that the menu requested. 

Research was very important to building this project. It took time to research how to solve problems and to see how others would soft thes same issues. 

The biggest skill to transfer is going to have to be the ability to research for different solution options. Then use that information to determin what path I want to take.
